A component of the Nameless lookout system started with KNELL. This component is the firmware for a particle device node that aggregates sensor data and routes to KNELL, our gateway, to communicate with the particle cloud. The purpose of this sensor data aggregation and collection is to ascertain, through data, abnormalities in conditions in the facility/ area independent of chiller operation or alert status.
